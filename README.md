Time-series analysis using the matrix profile. The matrix profile `P` tells you which sub-sequences of a time series `T` are similar to each other, and which are most dissimilar from all other. This will allow you to find repeated patterns, or *motifs*, as well as finding outliers.

The function `matrix_profile` returns the matrix profile and profile indices. Here's an example where we insert a repeated pattern in an otherwise random time series.
```julia
using MatrixProfile, Plots
t  = range(0, stop=1, step=1/10)
y0 = sin.(2pi .* t)
T  = [randn(20); y0; randn(20); y0; randn(20)]
window_length = length(y0)
profile = matrix_profile(T, window_length)
plot(profile) # Should have minima at 21 and 52
```

The matrix profile have two sharp minima at the onsets of the repeated pattern. The parameter `window_length` determines how long pattern to search for.

### Runtime
`matrix_profile` benefits greatly in speed from the use of `Float32` instead of `Float64`. The computational time scales as the square of the length of `T`, but is invariant to the window length. Calculating the matrix profile of `2^17 â‰ˆ 100k` points takes about a minute on a laptop.

## Motif grouping
Using the fake data from the example above, we can do
```julia
k = 2; r = 2; th = 5;
mot = motifs(profile, k, r, th)
plot(profile, mot)
```
- `k` is the number of motifs to extract
- `r` controls how similar two windows must be to belong to the same motif. A higher value leads to more windows being grouped together.
- `th` is a threshold on how far nearby in time two motifs are allowed to be.
